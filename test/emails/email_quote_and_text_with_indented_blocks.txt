I think it would be nice to have the final command (e.g. ‘id’ here, or
‘publish’ in ‘ipfs name publish’) be either the action you want to
take or the data you want to get back.  So if ‘ipfs id …’ is about
“give me a bunch of information about <peer>”, maybe it should be
‘ipfs peer …’.  Then we could have:

  $ ipfs peer --id
  QmbBHw1Xx9pUpAbrVZUKTPL5Rsph5Q9GQhRvcWVBPFgGtC

as a shortcut for:

  $ ipfs peer --format='<id>'
  QmbBHw1Xx9pUpAbrVZUKTPL5Rsph5Q9GQhRvcWVBPFgGtC

On the other hand, renames like this need an annoying multi-step
migration with a deprecation period, etc., so we'd want to do our best
to think through the indended UI to avoid further renames in the
coming months.  But we are talking about breaking the default output,
so maybe now is the time for that rename?
